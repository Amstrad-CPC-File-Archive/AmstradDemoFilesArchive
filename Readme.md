# Amstrad File Archive Project


This repository contains a certain amount of Amstrad CPC demos accessible from files.
You will not found DSK here, just Amsdos Compatible files.
You can copy them in a real floppy disc, or in a mass storage support supported by a dedicated OS.

Some files may not be original but modified files and hacked files to allow a loading with modern mass storage.

Fill free to propose any merge request to improve the organisation of the archive or provide additional files.
